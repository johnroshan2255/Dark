# DARK — Architecture

Browser co-op survival horror. Stylized, low-poly, fog-heavy procedural open world.
Target: **≥ 60 fps minimum on every supported device — ~₹15k Android phones, low-end PCs (Intel UHD) and
desktops — uncapped above** (display refresh), in Chrome/Firefox/Safari (WebGL2). Achieved with three quality
tiers + adaptive resolution (`src/rendering/quality/`, `skills/mobile`). Every game is a new random world
(seed shared with co-op peers).

## 1. Dependencies (and why each exists)

| Package | Why |
|---|---|
| `three` | Renderer, scene graph, math. Everything renders through it. |
| `@react-three/fiber` | Declarative scene composition, React lifecycle for mount/unmount/dispose, a single frame loop with priorities. |
| `@react-three/drei` | Used selectively (loaders `useGLTF`/`useTexture`, `KTX2`/`meshopt` wiring, helpers). **Not** used for the hot path. |
| `@dimforge/rapier3d-compat` | WASM physics: character controller, heightfield terrain, BMX rigid body. `-compat` embeds the wasm so Vite needs no plugin. Used directly (not `@react-three/rapier`) so we control body activation per chunk and step timing. |
| `react`, `react-dom` | UI + R3F host. |
| `vite`, `typescript`, `@vitejs/plugin-react` | Build. Vite gives native module workers (`new Worker(new URL(...))`) for chunk generation. |

Deliberately **not** added (yet): state libraries (we use a ~40-line external store), `postprocessing` (our single
combined grading pass is cheaper and fully controlled; revisit if we need SSAO/bloom mip chains), `@react-three/rapier`,
`leva`, ECS libraries. Add one only with a concrete measured reason.

---

## 2. Frame architecture

React is used for **composition and lifecycle**, never for per-frame state.

```
<App>                                 DOM: HUD, debug overlay (updated via refs, 4 Hz)
 └─ <GameCanvas>                      R3F <Canvas>, renderer config, dpr clamp
     └─ <GameProvider game>           one Game instance (plain TS class) in context
         ├─ <GameLoopDriver>          useFrame(priority -100): game.loop.tick(dt)
         ├─ <CameraRig>               camera params; camera pose written by player system
         ├─ <Lighting>                sun/hemi/flashlight objects registered with LightingSystem
         ├─ <Environment>             background/fog objects driven by TimeOfDay
         ├─ <World>                   <primitive> of WorldManager.root; chunks are added imperatively (WorldChunk.ts)
         └─ <Effects>                 useFrame(priority 1): takes over rendering → PostPipeline
```

### Per-frame order (`src/game/GameLoop.ts`)

1. `look` — mouse/touch deltas → yaw/pitch (per render frame, not fixed step)
2. `fixed` (accumulator, 60 Hz, max 4 substeps) — player controller, Rapier step, interpolation alpha
3. `timeOfDay` — continuous hours, sun/moon directions, nightmare weight
4. `camera` — FPP eye or TPP over-the-shoulder orbit with Rapier ray-cast pull-in; animates the character; sets the
   flashlight origin/aim (must precede culling)
4. `world` — streaming (worker requests, ≤2 builds/frame), chunk LOD with hysteresis, chunk frustum culling, physics ring
5. `timeOfDay` → `lighting` — blend phase params, sun shadow follows player, flashlight, fog, grading uniforms
6. `debug` — chunk bounds / physics wireframes (only when enabled)
7. *(R3F render phase)* `Effects` → `Game.render()`: scene → RT → grading pass → screen, then `PerformanceMonitor.endFrame()`

High-frequency data (positions, velocities, instance matrices) lives in plain objects / typed arrays and is written to
Three.js objects directly. React state changes only for: chunk set changes, LOD changes, UI mode changes.

---

## 3. World model

```
World (seed)
 └─ Chunk grid, CHUNK_SIZE = 64 m, heights sampled every 2 m (33×33, `CHUNK_RES = 32`) — deliberately low-poly
     └─ per chunk: terrain mesh (LOD 0/1/2), instanced trees/rocks/plants, colliders (near only)
```

- **Generation is pure**: `generateChunk(seed, cx, cz) → ChunkData` (typed arrays only). Runs in a Web Worker
  (`src/world/Streaming/chunk.worker.ts`). Same seed ⇒ same world on every client. Generation uses only
  arithmetic + `Math.floor` (no `Math.random`, no `sin/cos` in anything gameplay-relevant).
- **Road** is a global analytic function `roadCenterX(z)` so any chunk can evaluate it without neighbours.
- **Streaming radii** (in chunks, Chebyshev distance from player chunk). The **render ring and LOD rings are per
  quality tier** (LOW 2 / MEDIUM 3 / HIGH 4 — `QualityTiers.ts`); the values below are HIGH:

| System | Radius | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Data generated/cached | 5 | worker output kept in LRU |
| Render | 4 | mesh built, subject to frustum culling |
| LOD0 (full detail, small plants, shadows) | ≤1 | |
| LOD1 | 2–3 | half-res terrain, no small plants |
| LOD2 | 4 | quarter-res terrain, trees only, low-poly |
| Physics colliders | 1 | heightfield + trunk colliders |
| AI active | 2 | monsters beyond are frozen/despawned |
| Audio emitters | 2 | |
| Interaction | ≤ 0 (same chunk + raycast) | |

**Why chunks are not React components:** chunk creation is gated by a per-frame build budget, LOD switching
is a visibility flip on pre-built meshes, and disposal must free exactly the per-chunk buffers (never shared
geometry/materials). Doing that imperatively in `WorldChunk.ts` avoids reconciler work and `dispose` pitfalls;
React still owns the mount point (`<World>`).

Hysteresis: a chunk switches LOD / unloads only when distance crosses the threshold **+1 ring** (unload) or by a
margin of 0.35 chunk (LOD), so standing on a border does not thrash.

---

## 4. Rendering

- `WebGLRenderer` created by R3F, configured in `src/rendering/renderer/configureRenderer.ts`:
  `antialias:false` (MSAA is on the scene render target instead), `powerPreference:'high-performance'`,
  `info.autoReset = false` (we reset once per frame so multi-pass stats are correct), DPR clamp `[1, 1.5]`,
  dynamic resolution scale on the scene RT.
- **Post pipeline** (`src/rendering/postprocessing/PostPipeline.ts`): scene → HalfFloat RT (MSAA 4) → one
  fullscreen shader: grading (lift/gamma/gain/saturation/tint), vignette, grain, nightmare distortion,
  tone mapping + sRGB. **One extra fullscreen pass total.**
- **Materials** (`src/rendering/materials/MaterialLibrary.ts`): shared, created once. Terrain & vegetation use
  `MeshLambertMaterial` + vertex colors (cheapest lit material that still takes fog and shadows). GLB assets may
  keep `MeshStandardMaterial` but get remapped to library materials when possible.
- **Fog**: linear-range `THREE.Fog` (smoothstep near→far): **clear up close, closing in at distance** (DAY 70→260 m,
  NIGHT 35→170 m), `far` capped at the tier's ring edge (`fogLimit`). Replaced FogExp2, which hazed everything from 0 m.
  Tone mapping: Khronos PBR Neutral (keeps the reference's saturation). Sun/moon shadows fade out at the shadow-map edge
  (`rendering/shadows/ShadowEdgeFade.ts`).
  distance, which sets the streaming radius, which sets the budget.
- **Shadows**: one directional shadow (sun/moon), 2048², tight ortho frustum (~70 m) following the player, snapped
  to texels. Only LOD0 chunk content casts. Flashlight shadow optional (1 map, 512²). Everything else: fake blob
  shadows / AO baked into vertex colors.
- **Lighting phases**: `DAY → EVENING → NIGHT → NIGHTMARE` keyframes in `src/rendering/lighting/TimeOfDay.ts`.

---

### Beyond the chunks
Horizon terrain (1 draw, worker-built, rebuilt every size/6 of travel) shows the world to ~0.8–1.5 km; a single
water plane at `WorldFields.WATER` shows lakes/rivers wherever terrain dips below it. Fog therefore closes at
the horizon, not at the chunk ring (see skills/art-direction, skills/fog).

## 5. Optimization layers

```
World → loaded chunk ring (streaming radius)
      → chunk AABB vs frustum (≤ ~80 tests / frame)       ChunkVisibility
      → chunk LOD ring                                    LodSelector
      → per-object Three frustum test only inside visible chunks (few objects per chunk)
```

Never iterate individual trees on the CPU per frame. Trees are `InstancedMesh` per chunk per species per LOD,
with a bounding sphere covering the chunk; the chunk decides visibility.

---

## 6. Physics (Rapier)

- `src/physics/PhysicsWorld.ts` owns the Rapier world, fixed 60 Hz step with accumulator.
- Terrain: one heightfield collider per chunk inside physics radius; removed when leaving it.
- Trees: fixed cylinder collider for trunk only, only inside physics radius. No colliders for plants/grass/rocks < 0.5 m.
- Player: `KinematicCharacterController` + capsule.
- BMX (future): dynamic rigid body + raycast wheels.

---

## 7. Multiplayer (future, structure reserved)

Host-authoritative (one peer or a small Node relay). Clients send inputs; host simulates players/monsters and
sends snapshots at 20 Hz; clients interpolate 100 ms in the past. World is **not** sent — only the seed and
deltas (opened doors, looted items). Streaming on the host is the union of all players' rings.
